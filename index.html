        <p>The word <i><b><mark>"Mother"</mark></b></i> resonates with <ins>blissful unconditional love and care</ins> that is the basic need of every child. The reasons for her existence in a child's life is endless and it applies to the entire living world of humans and animals. Infact,she is the most precious gift of <em><strong>Allah</strong></em> for anyone. The connect of children with mothers seems to be eternal as this bond starts way before birth. If we go to jot down the list of reasons that make moms so important, then it might seem endless, but we have listed five most crucial reasons why a mother is so important for a child.<br><br>
            
        <mark><b>1. Mother’s love is unconditional</b></mark><br><br>One look in a mother’s eye for her child and we come to realise the meaning of unconditional love. Though we all have become a pro with words and can exactly convey our emotions, expressing a mother’s love in words is still very difficult. For a mother, a child always remains her baby even if he turns 60 or becomes a tycoon, a leader or a thinker. Mothers hold this strong aspect of loving their children in any phase of life or situation. This unconditional love of mothers is what makes them so special for every child.<br><br>

        <mark><b>2. Mother’s are the 1st teachers</b></mark><br><br>For a child, the process of learning starts right from the birth or even before it. We all know that during pregnancy mothers are told to read good books, listen to soothing music and so on. They do this because though the child is still to face the world, but the baby already develops a connection with the world through the mother. Later, the baby is acquainted with the world, 1st by their mothers and later by others. Whatever the language, caste or custom, every baby learns to call his/her mother first. “Mother, ma, amma” is the first word that comes out from the baby’s mouth. A mother teaches her child everything that she knows right from talking, walking to living a fulfilling life. She is also the one who disciplines and educates a child for a better living. Right from getting up to sleeping, a mother teaches all she knows. Mother also goes through the process of learning again to help her child gain better knowledge.<br><br>

        <mark><b>3. Mother’s give hope</b></mark><br><br>If it weren’t for mothers, this world would sound pretty hopeless. It is a fact that life is filled with varied experiences and some of them are not so good. A child faces these situations right from the start, but it is the mother who, with her love, care and comfort assure that in the end good always prevails. Through her eyes and confidence, a child can always see the light on the other side of the tunnel. Whether facing exams, competitions or the hardships of life, children always seek guidance and support from their mothers first.<br><br>
        
        <mark><b>4. Mother’s know their children inside out</b></mark><br><br>For a mother, her child is an open book. She knows her child like no other. Whatever the child feels, mother knows it, and nothing remains hidden from her. She is the best judge of her child’s personality, and she makes sure that the child is treated and disciplined accordingly. Knowing her child’s interests and needs, she accommodates new changes for the betterment and overall development of her child. E.g. enrolling the child in activities like swimming, dancing, drawing, changing school and the pattern of learning to name a few.<br><br>

        <mark><b>5. Mother’s are foundations and pillars</b></mark><br><br>We all need that someone on whom we can fall back on in times of crisis, especially emotional ones. What better than the arms of a mother where all the problems, insecurities and negative feelings come to a standstill. A child always needs the support of the mother, be it any phase of life like going to school, marriage, having a baby. She is the one who acts like a strong pillar on which a child can depend.<br><br>

        Mother’s position is also very high in the religious view of Islam.it is said,<b><q>your paradise lies under the feet of your mother</q></b><br>
        <blockquote>Book<sup>32</sup>, Number <sub>6181</sub>:
            <i><b>Abu Huraira</b></i> <del>reported</del> that a person said: Allah's Messenger, who amongst the people is most deserving of my good treatment? He said: Your mother, again your mother, again your mother, then your father, then your nearest relatives according to the order (of nearness).
            </blockquote>

        <!--How we should take care of our Mother’s-->

        <p><mark><b>Love the way she does</b></mark><br><br>
        We can never pay back for whatever a mother has done and continues to do for us. All we can do is reciprocate the same love and affection just the way she does. Though a mother will never ask anything in return for her love, care and protection, we can always make her feel special with small and sweet gestures. So if you are thinking of making her feel special, take Mother’s Day or her birthday as an opportunity to tell her how important she is to you. Express your love with pink flowers, and she is sure to appreciate your sweet gesture.
